# Bring the Band!
## An app that allows you to search and vote for your favorite band using Spotify API

### Planning Process --
1. Sketch wireframes noting all endpoints and user events
2. Data modeling
  - Session model, Band model and Bands collection created with Kinvey
  - Search model and collection created by accessing Spotify database
3. Break down wireframes into functional user components
4. Identify any special features and whether it's necessary to manipulate/modify data and components

### Building Process --
1. Constructed router
2. Built search component to fetch data from Spotify. This included a single result. It was more helpful for me to fetch the data first so that I had real data to work with rather than writing out code without being able to see it's functionality in browser.
3. User account functionality
4. Voting system
5. Testing --Ideally, I would like to do this before building out the code but being a novice, it's helpful to me to see that it works and build tests around it. It also helped me clean up my code.
6. Stylin'

### Challenges --
1. Writing tests and writing testable code is a new concept so it was difficult for me to execute this.
2. Lots of trials and tribulations with getting the voting system set up but overall, I understood the process.

### Improvements --
1. Update features with more user specificity
